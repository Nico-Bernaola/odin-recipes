    <p>
      This recipe makes a delicious, lightly spiced filling, stuffed with little
      bites of soft egg, salty olives, and tender meat and veggies.
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
      <li>1 medium onion, chopped</li>
      <li>1 medium red bell pepper, seeded and diced (Optional)</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon bottled minced garlic</li>
      <li>Â½ cup green olives, pitted and chopped</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon ground paprika, or to taste</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin, or to taste</li>
      <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
      <li>2 large hard-boiled eggs, coarsely chopped</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <h4>Step 1</h4>
        <p>
          Prepare filling: Cook ground beef, onion, bell pepper, and garlic in a
          large, nonstick skillet over medium to medium-high heat until
          vegetables are tender and beef is browned and crumbly, about 10
          minutes. Add olives, paprika, cumin, salt, and pepper. Stir in chopped
          eggs.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>Step 2</h4>
        <p>
          Scrape mixture into a bowl. Cover and refrigerate until fully chilled,
          1 to 2 hours; this ensures the dough will not be soggy when the
          empanadas are baked.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>Step 3</h4>
        <p>
          Prepare dough: Whisk flour and salt together in a medium bowl until
          combined. Cut in butter with a pastry blender until the mixture
          resembles coarse crumbs.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>Step 4</h4>
        <p>
          Whisk cold water, egg, and vinegar together in a small bowl. Pour into
          the dry ingredients and blend with a fork. Use your hands to finish
          blending the ingredients until they come together in a ball. Flatten
          the ball into a disc, wrap with plastic wrap, and refrigerate for 1
          hour.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>Step 5</h4>
        <p>
          When you are ready to cook, preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175
          degrees C).
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>Step 6</h4>
        <p>
          Roll the dough on a lightly floured surface. Use a 3-inch round cutter
          to cut circles, rerolling the scraps as necessary. I got about 18
          circles.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>Step 7</h4>
        <p>
          Hold each circle in your hand and place a heaping tablespoon of
          filling in the center. Gently fold the ends over the top and press to
          seal all the way around. Reserve extra filling for another use.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>Step 8</h4>
        <p>
          Set empanadas on a baking sheet. Press around the sealed edges with a
          fork if desired.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>Step 9</h4>
        <p>
          Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown on the bottoms, about 18
          minutes. Flip and bake until the other side is browned, about 5 more
          minutes.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Notes</h3>
    <p>You can use Kalamata olives, if preferred.</p>
